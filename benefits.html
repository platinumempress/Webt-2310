                <H2>Blueberries - Antioxidant Powerhouse</H2>
                <p>Blueberries are small but mighty, packed with powerful antioxidants called flavonoids. 
                   These compounds help reduce oxidative stress in the body, which can lower the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer. 
                   Regular consumption of blueberries is also linked to improved brain function and memory, making them a great addition to your diet.</p>
                <p>In addition to their antioxidant properties, blueberries are high in vitamin C and fiber, which support a healthy immune system and 
                   digestive health. Add them to your breakfast cereal, yogurt, or enjoy them as a snack for a tasty and healthful boost.</p>

                        <p>Bananas are a favorite for their convenience and nutrient density. They are an excellent source of potassium, which is crucial

                        <p>Beyond their energy-boosting qualities, bananas also support digestive health thanks to their soluble fiber content. They can help regulate blood sugar levels and keep you feeling full, making 
                           them a great choice for a healthy diet.</p>
                        <p>The saying "an apple a day keeps the doctor away" holds some truth, as apples are packed with important nutrients. High in dietary fiber, apples aid in digestion and help maintain healthy 
                           cholesterol levels. They are also a good source of vitamin C, which supports the immune system and skin health.</p>
